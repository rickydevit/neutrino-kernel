# Neutrino Kernel Project
This project is a personal way to discover and implement a 64 bit kernel written in C and Assembly. The kernel will have basic drivers and functionality, but other features may be added in the future. The currently implemented features are listed below.

## Features
- [x] â›± **Limine bootloader** as the main boot-up solution for the moment
    - [x] **Stivale2 protocol compliant** 

- [ ] ðŸŒ³ **Basic kernel drivers**
    - [ ] **GDT** setup
    - [ ] **IDT** setup
    - [x] **Serial comms**
    - [ ] **PIT**
    - [ ] **APIC**
    - [ ] **CPUID** 
    - [ ] **RTC**
    - [ ] **Memory manager**, both physical and virtual
    - [ ] **Process manager**

- [ ] âš™ **Advanced drivers**
    - [x] **Video driver**
        - [x] **Plot pixel**
        - [ ] **Draw line**
        - [ ] **Draw complex shapes**
    - [ ] **USB driver**
    - [ ] **Network driver**
    - [ ] **Storage drivers**
    - [ ] **Filesystem drivers**

- [ ] ðŸ‘¤ **Userspace**
    - [ ] **System calls**
    - [ ] *And many apps*
