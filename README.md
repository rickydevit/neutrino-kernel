### ![Neutrino Kernel Project](./utils/logo.png)
*Neutrino* is a project that aims to understand and implement a 64 bit kernel written in a modern C and Assembly. The kernel will have basic drivers and functionality, but other features may be added in the future. The currently implemented features are listed [here](#Features). 

## Milestones
- [ ] **0 ãƒ¼ Reaching Userspace** â¬…  
    *Implement everything needed for reaching a simple userspace*
- [ ] 1 ãƒ¼ Storage land   
    *Implement a VFS to access installed drives, writing and reading files*
- [ ] 2 ãƒ¼ Network stack   
    *Add a network stack to ping, send and receive packets*
- [ ] 3 ãƒ¼ Graphical impovements   
    *Improve the GUI and the UX of the userspace, adding controls and a window manager*

## Features
- [x] â›± **Limine bootloader** as the main boot-up solution for the moment
    - [x] **Stivale2 protocol compliant**   
        *The kernel asks the bootloader for a linear framebuffer, but can also use a terminal if the framebuffer is not available. The bootloader also pass some informations to the kernel.*

- [ ] ðŸŒ³ **Basic kernel**
    - [x] **Kernel Services**  
        *The kernel services functions are used to provide a easier to way to interface the kernel and the drivers. These functions will NOT be available to the user space. Also enables kernel components to log and throw fatal exceptions with [specific codes](/utils/documentation/KernelService%20Fatal%20Codes.md)*
    - [x] **GDT setup**   
        *Null descriptor; 32 bit code and data descriptors; 64 bit code and data descriptors. More descriptors will be added when required.*
    - [x] **IDT setup**   
        *Basic x86_64 interrupts and exceptions handled. Software interrupts will be added when necessary.*
    - [x] **Serial comms**   
        *Serial communication with write and read operations from and to a given serial port*
    - [x] **SSE**   
        *Floating point unit initialization and XSAVE/AVX check and enabling*
    - [x] **ACPI**   
        *Basic ACPI tables listing and parsing*
         - [x] **RSDT/XSDT**   
            *with the possibility to find tables*
         - [x] **MADT**   
            *including the LAPIC, IOAPIC, IOAPIC_ISO sub-tables*
    - [x] **APIC**
         - [x] **IOAPIC initialization**   
            *with regards to the Interrupt Source Override table*
         - [x] **LAPIC initialization**
    - [x] **SMD (Symmetric multi-processing)**
        - [x] **Per-CPU initialization (via stivale2)**
    - [x] **CPUID** 
    - [ ] **Timers**
        - [x] **RTC** `ðŸš§ WIP`
        - [x] **LAPIC timer**
        - [ ] **PIT** `ðŸ”» LOW PRIORITY`
        - [x] **HPET**
    - [x] **Memory manager**
        - [x] **Physical memory manager**   
            *Scans the loaded memory and manages it using 4KB blocks. Kernel and other reserved areas are marked accordingly*
        - [x] **Virtual memory manager**   
            *Manages the virtual memory page tables. Can map, remap and unmap pages*
        - [ ] **Kernel Heap manager**
    - [ ] **Executable loading**
    - [ ] **Process scheduler** `ðŸ”— Timers, Executable loading`

- [ ] âš™ **Advanced drivers**
    - [x] **Video driver**
        - [x] **Plot pixel**
        - [ ] **Draw line**
        - [ ] **Draw complex shapes**
    - [ ] **USB driver**
    - [ ] **Network driver**
    - [ ] **Storage drivers**
    - [ ] **Filesystem drivers**

- [ ] ðŸ‘¤ **Userspace**
    - [ ] **System calls**
    - [ ] *And many apps*
